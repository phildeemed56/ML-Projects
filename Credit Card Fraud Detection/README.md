**Credit Card Fraud Detection Project**

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques. The dataset used in this project comprises credit card transactions carried out by European cardholders in September 2013. It spans two days and encompasses 284,807 transactions, out of which 492 are identified as fraudulent. The imbalance in the dataset is striking, with fraudulent transactions constituting a mere 0.172% of the total.

**Dataset Information**

The dataset includes numerical input variables resulting from a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) transformation. PCA yielded features V1 through V28.

'Time' denotes the time elapsed in seconds since the first transaction, while 'Amount' represents the transaction value.

The target variable 'Class' indicates whether a transaction is fraudulent (1) or not (0).

Evaluation Metric

Due to the significant class imbalance, accuracy alone is not a reliable metric for model evaluation. Instead, the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) is used.

**Steps Involved:**

Import Modules: Necessary Python libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib are imported.

Loading the Dataset: The dataset is loaded, typically from a CSV file or a URL.

Preprocessing the Dataset: Any necessary preprocessing steps are performed, such as handling missing values or encoding categorical variables.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Basic statistics and visualizations are used to understand the data distribution and relationships.

Correlation Matrix: A correlation matrix is generated to understand the relationships between features.

Input Split: The dataset is split into input features (X) and the target variable (y).

Standard Scaling: Input features are often scaled to ensure that all features contribute equally to the model.

Model Training: Machine learning models, such as logistic regression or random forest, are trained on the dataset.

Class Imbalancement: Techniques to handle class imbalance, such as oversampling or undersampling, are applied to improve model performance.

**Instructions to Run the Code:**
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Install the required libraries using pip or conda.

Download the dataset or specify the dataset URL in the code.

Run the Python script or notebook cells.

**Results and Discussion:**
Discuss the performance of different models and techniques used.

Present the AUPRC scores and any other relevant metrics.

Discuss any challenges faced during the project and potential improvements.

**Conclusion:**
Credit card fraud detection is a critical task in the financial industry. This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to detect fraudulent transactions, considering the significant class imbalance in the dataset. By using appropriate evaluation metrics and preprocessing techniques, it is possible to build models that effectively identify fraudulent transactions, thereby enhancing security and trust in financial transactions.
