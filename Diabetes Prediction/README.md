Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
This project aims to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using machine learning techniques, particularly Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. The dataset used in this project contains various health-related features such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, etc., which are used to train the model to predict whether an individual has diabetes or not.

Introduction
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Early detection and management of diabetes are crucial for preventing complications and improving overall health outcomes. Machine learning techniques offer a promising approach to predict diabetes risk based on various health parameters.

This project utilizes a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to analyze a dataset containing information about individuals' health metrics and predict whether they have diabetes or not. SVM is a powerful classification algorithm known for its effectiveness in handling high-dimensional data and non-linear relationships between features.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following features:

Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
Blood Pressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
Skin Thickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
Diabetes Pedigree Function: Diabetes pedigree function
Age: Age in years
Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1) indicating whether the individual has diabetes or not
Requirements
To run this project, you need the following dependencies:

Python (>=3.6)
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
You can install the required packages using the following command:

Model Evaluation
The performance of the SVM model is evaluated using accuracy score, which measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances out of the total instances. The model's accuracy is calculated on both the training and testing datasets to assess its generalization ability.

Future Improvements
There are several ways to enhance this project:

Explore other machine learning algorithms and compare their performance with SVM.
Perform feature engineering to extract more meaningful features from the dataset.
Hyperparameter tuning to optimize the SVM model's performance.
Collect more data to improve the model's accuracy and robustness.
