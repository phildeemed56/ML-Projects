**Car Price Prediction Project**

This project aims to predict car prices using machine learning models such as Linear Regression and Lasso Regression. The dataset used contains information about various car attributes like year, selling price, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission, and owner details.

**Introduction**

Predicting car prices is essential for both buyers and sellers in the automotive market. Machine learning models can help in estimating car prices based on various attributes, enabling better decision-making for both parties. In this project, we use the Python programming language along with popular libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and scikit-learn to build and evaluate machine learning models for car price prediction.

**Installation**

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system. You also need to install the required Python packages listed in the requirements.txt file. You can install them using pip:



**Data Preprocessing**

Loading Data: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.

Inspecting Data: Check the first few rows, data types, and missing values in the dataset.

Encoding Categorical Data: Convert categorical variables into numerical equivalents.

Splitting Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model training and evaluation.

**Model Training and Evaluation**

Linear Regression: Train a Linear Regression model and evaluate its performance using metrics like R-squared error.

Lasso Regression: Train a Lasso Regression model and compare its performance with Linear Regression.

Model Evaluation: Use the trained linear regression model and lasso regression model to generate predictions for the input features of the training data and compute the R-square to indicate the variation in the target variable (Selling_Price) explained by the independent variables (features) in both linear regression model and lasso regression model.
